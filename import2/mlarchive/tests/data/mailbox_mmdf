A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts

       Date      : 09/08/1994

This memo is an introductory guide to some of the TCP/IP and Internet tools
and utilities that allow users to access the wide variety of information on
the network, from determining if a particular host is up to viewing a 
multimedia thesis on foreign policy.  It also describes discussion lists 
accessible from the Internet, ways to obtain Internet documents, and 
resources that help users weave their way through the Internet.  This memo 
may be used as a tutorial for individual self-learning, a step-by-step 
laboratory manual for a course, or as the basis for a site's users manual. 
It is intended as a basic guide only and will refer to other sources for 
more detailed information.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

The issue has come up recently about the use of quoted-printable vs. 8-bit in
netnews postings and in particular in the NNTP protocol.  It appears, from a
cursory examination of the status quo, that officially netnews is 7-bit;
however, ``just send 8 bits'' is common practice within the netnews community.

``Common practice'', as opposed to an IETF standard, does little to give us
warm fuzzy feelings; and as a veteran of the ``just send 8 bits'' SMTP wars I
am particularly nervous about travelling down that slippery slop.

On the other hand, it is arguable that the ``all the world is UNIX'' attitude
is an acceptable one for netnews and there really is no problem with ``just
send 8 bits'' in netnews.  There is, of course, a problem for implementors of
software that supports both mail and news, since they would have to keep
firmly in mind that they can't ``just send 8 bits'' in mail (read: we'll see a
lot of illicit 8-bit SMTP to non-EHLO servers).

The purpose of this message is to get discussion going on this question, if it
isn't already, and hopefully result in a ruling.  Maybe (shudder!) it's time
for an IETF-NNTP working group?  ;-)

There was an NNTP v2 effort a while ago, but it petered out from lack
of interest.

As one of the original authors of NNTP, and as a participant in the
MIME effort, I can authoritatively say that NNTP was indeed explicitly
7-bit NETASCII, and anyone just sending 8 bits is in violation of
protocol. The whole idea behind MIME was to get the user interface
software changed to properly support character sets other than ASCII
*independent* of transport and it does no damn good if we don't label
the silly things which is where the "just send 8 bits" idiocy leaves
us. This goes for NetNews too.
