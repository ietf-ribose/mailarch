Looks like the registrar though.  They may be able to help a little 
more.  Looking at the page it appears that you are the owner... ;-)

Does anybody know who the owner of caldav.org is?  That domain has 
currently got a frame showing the CalDAV resources page I put up a few 
weeks ago (http://ietf.webdav.org/caldav) but we don't know how long 
that will last or whether to count on it.

thx,
Lisa

In case anybody's still following this thread 8-) ... I now find myself
in agreement with Roy, that POST is appropriate and that ADDMEMBER ==
POST.

I was looking at the interaction from the POV of a tweak on PUT
semantics, rather than as the submission of a document to a
state-preserving container (which I should have recognized it as
immediately, given my previous attempts at describing such a
model[1]).

I'm still not convinced that a POST extension (which declared the
expected type of the target resource) wouldn't improve the
self-descriptiveness of the message, but practically, that's pretty
much irrelevant for the purposes of this discussion.

You are missing that the target of PUT is the new resource,
whereas the target of POST and ADDMEMBER are both the collection
resource.  As such, ADDMEMBER's semantics has very little in
common with PUT (almost nothing, in fact, since any unsafe
extension method can return 201 and communicate just as much,
whereas PUT is unique in what it communicates by the 200/201).
