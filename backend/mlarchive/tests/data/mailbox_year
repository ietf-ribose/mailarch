If we assume that the interfaces are dedicated to being either internal or
external to the NE, and we assume that the CE actually has per-interface
OSPF configuration, then it won't start OSPF on those interfaces.
In that case, a protocol such as BFD would seem sensible.

I could equally easily imagine the normal configuration being
"run OSPF'
"noroute internal"
which would enable OSPF on all interfaces, and then tell the enigne not to
bother exchanging routing information on internal interfaces.

There are probably other existing alternatives I have not thought of that
can be used.
We should be very cautious before inventing another protocol for a problem
that comes up repeatedly (neighbor detection.)

It may be that we do need a very light weight specialized protocol.
I want to understand what problem it is to solve and its relationship to
existing work before discussing the design details of the protocol.

Yours,
Joel

Sorry, looks like my previous mail had formatting problems with the
figure.... let me try again.

--------------------
Joel,

  I am trying to understand what you are saying. Let's take this simple
example of an NE with three different FEs in it - See figure below. If a
routing protocol such as OSPF is started on this NE, the CE will send hello
packets to neighboring NEs (NE2 and NE3) only through interfaces configured
in OSPF - which would be interface "D" on FE1 and "B" on FE2. It would not
be correct behavior if the CE decides to send the routing protocol Hellos
through all the interfaces on an FE - that haven't been configured for that
routing protocol - i.e. CE should not send hellos on interface "B" and "C"
on FE1 and "C" and "D" of FE2. Further FE3 is completely internal to the NE
and who is it sending it's hello packets to?

The discovery is meant to discover the internal topology - albiet
through as
simple a mechanim as a hello protocol - but has been delineated from the
routing protocol Hellos.

Thanks,

Joel,
    I am trying to understand what you are saying. Let's take this
simple example of an NE with three
different FEs in it - See figure below. If a routing protocol such as
OSPF is started on this NE, the CE
will send hello packets to neighboring NEs (NE2 and NE3) only through
interfaces configured in OSPF -
which would be interface "D" on FE1 and "B" on FE2. It would not be
correct behavior if the CE
decides to send the routing protocol Hellos through all the interfaces
on an FE - that haven't been
configured for that routing protocol - i.e. CE should not send hellos on
interface "B" and "C" on FE1
and "C" and "D" of FE2. Further FE3 is completely internal to the NE and
who is it sending it's hello
packets to?
The discovery is meant to discover the internal topology - albiet
through as simple a mechanim as
a hello protocol - but has been delineated from the routing protocol Hellos.

Thanks,

I would agree that running a separate instance of the routing protocol
within the FE would be undesirable.

However, the CE could send routing protocol hellos through all the
interfaces, and receive routing protocol hellos through all the
interfaces.  It could then sensibly decide that hello maintenance is all it
needs on any adjacency for which it is both sides.  (Note, a normal router
with two physical interfaces on the same subnet has to do this anyway.)

This works if the interface is shared with elements not within the NE, and
works if the interface is dedicated to the NE.  It requires no new protocols.
There may be requirements it does not meet.  But we should articulate those
and agree on the relevance of such requirements.

Yours,
Joel
